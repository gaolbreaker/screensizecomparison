# screensizecomparison

by Elbert and Lawrence

I'm trying to create a simple tool to help people make informed decisions regarding what monitor(s) to buy. I'm thinking primarily about screen real estate, both square inches and the number of pixels.

I think about monitors a lot (weird, huh?) and what the ideal set up would be. For example, right now I'm working on two 32-in 2k monitors. That means I get 875 sq in of viewing area, and 7 million pixels. Someone with a single 43-in 4k monitor would get 790 sq in of viewing area, and 8 million pixels.
